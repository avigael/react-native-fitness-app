# React Native Fitness App

This demo app was built using React Native for the front-end allowing it to easily work with both iOS and Android devices. The backend is written using Python and Flask and uses a SQLlite database. Authentication is done through tokens. You can look at the back end code [here](https://github.com/avigael/REST-example "here").
